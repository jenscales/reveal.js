					Why did we create the shed?  I had a problem. Need to switch out a lightbuld. Went to the local hardware store to purchase a ladder. The ladder was over $300! to change out a $2.00 lightbulb. I wish I knew who I could borrow a ladder from!

						<h3>Notes:</h3>
						<p>
							Meet our user Gamble. Gamble needs a ladder to reach his most distant burnt-out bulb. When he first enters the Shed, he sees all the available tools in his community. He searches for a ladder and sees that there are a few near to him. Seeing these options, he then checks the map to decide which one to pursue. He clicks on the one he prefers to borrow and is brought to a page with more details. After reviewing this, he decides to go forth and request the item, adding a note that he needs a ladder for a quick job of changing a lightbulb. Upon submitting his request, the ladder's owner will be emailed a notification of this. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Having asked for the ladder, Gamble decides to review the recent requests he has received for his own tools. He sees that Jennifer is interested in borrowing his power washer. He opens up her request, reviews the message, and kindly approves of it. From this same page, Gamble can review the tools he has listed as available to his neighbors. He can also see listed here any tools he has borrowed and yet to return. Gamble is also curious to see who else has joined the Shed. He is equally as able to view the app from his phone and to check out this information.
